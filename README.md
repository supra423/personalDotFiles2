This is a replacement for my old personalDotFiles repository!

I'm still gonna keep the old one for some references while working on this.
I switched from Hyprland to Sway here, didn't thought it would be this good tbh,
Sway isn't too bad! Credits to Diinki though, I stole their Wofi config lol.
I also have this "oomox-eboda2" which is a theme to load using dconf-editor,
this changes the theme of apps that use GTK.
