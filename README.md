This is a replacement for my old personalDotFiles repository!

I'm still gonna keep the old one for some references while working on this.
I switched from Hyprland to Sway here, didn't thought it would be this good tbh,
Sway isn't too bad! Credits to Diinki though, I stole their Wofi config lol.
The tmux might need for you to clone the "janoamaral/tokyo-night-tmux" repository
